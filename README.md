Open Terms
==========

This browser addon serves as a proof of concept, to explore a browser-based intervention around terms & conditions. 

Millions of people are subject to millions of words that we rarely read or understand. Despite the buttons we press to confirm, we often disagree with the terms. 

The entire conflict centers around a little checkbox. This locus gives us a unique opportunity to intervene. 

When someone visits a page to signup or join, the browser addon presents a series of opportunities to learn more or take action.* They aim to make unobtrusive connections to existing campaigns and alternative software.
