# Open Terms

This plugin serves as a proof of concept, to explore a browser-based intervention around terms and conditions. 

Millions of people are subject to millions of words that we rarely read or understand. Despite the press of a confirmation button, we usually disagree to the terms. 

This entire conflict centers around a little checkbox. The focus gives us unique opportunity to intervene. 

When someone visits a page to signup or join, the browser presents a series of opportunities to learn more or take action. They aim to make unobtrusive to existing campaigns and alternative software.
